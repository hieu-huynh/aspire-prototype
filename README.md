### [Demo](https://eager-bell-6da349.netlify.app/)

# How it works

- This is a simple website prototype that allows a customer to enter a “amount” and “loan term”.
- All the loans will be assumed to have a “weekly” repayment frequency.
- The customer can see weekly amount to be repaid and is able to submit the weekly loan repayments.
